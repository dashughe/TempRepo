[8:36:12 PM] Ritesh Modi: HI Dan
[8:36:14 PM] Ritesh Modi: Good Morning
[8:36:53 PM] Ritesh Modi: in the Membership module and EF i have to many RND at every point
[8:37:32 PM] Ritesh Modi: i dont know in future what kind of problem it may create for us
[8:37:58 PM] Ritesh Modi: I have just implimented the custom code with WCF service where everything is designed by us
[8:38:02 PM] Daniel Hughes: RND ??
[8:38:39 PM] Ritesh Modi: RND=Need to search for solution every time
[8:38:44 PM] Daniel Hughes: ok - then we will not use EF for now - it is not necessary for us IMHO
[8:39:25 PM] Ritesh Modi: in membership module we can implement it as part of WEb application
[8:39:46 PM] Ritesh Modi: if we try to create it a seperate WCF service then it give error
[8:40:41 PM] Ritesh Modi: I will send you the some code that i have done for WCF in other project for your understanding so that you will get aware that how i deal with it
[8:41:41 PM] Ritesh Modi: WE can use EF but this is also has issue that we need to write our code in Class library
[8:41:59 PM] Ritesh Modi: which is not loosly coupled coding
[8:42:04 PM] Daniel Hughes: ok
[8:42:23 PM] Ritesh Modi: we can use it as just only DataLayer
[8:42:26 PM] Daniel Hughes: for engine, I want WCF and some reliable & safe way of authentication/authorization...
[8:42:35 PM] Daniel Hughes: membership or not - let me know...
[8:42:45 PM] Daniel Hughes: EF is not big concern for me right now
[8:42:58 PM] Daniel Hughes: are you still logging time in toggl?
[8:43:11 PM] Ritesh Modi: No
[8:43:28 PM] Daniel Hughes: please do that - need to track your hours for payment
[8:44:59 PM] Ritesh Modi: Ok i will do that. From Now onward i will try to use EF as datalayer with custom StoreProcedures for communicating with database.
[8:45:11 PM] Daniel Hughes: ok
[8:45:27 PM] Daniel Hughes: i hope to be able to work on it with you soon
[8:45:51 PM] Ritesh Modi: I will include some feature like permission on Some methods that will check that user has permission to execute any method
[8:46:16 PM] Ritesh Modi: sure that will be great
[8:46:54 PM] Ritesh Modi: So here is the plan
[8:48:28 PM] Ritesh Modi: 1)Develop a Webapplication that will content all .aspx pages.
2) WCF service for communicating with database for SEcurity related implementation
3) WCF service for Communicating Shipment related implementation.
[8:49:18 PM] Ritesh Modi: 4) Error loging
[8:49:40 PM] Ritesh Modi: and many other feature
[8:49:44 PM] Daniel Hughes: ok
[8:49:49 PM] Ritesh Modi: Thanks
